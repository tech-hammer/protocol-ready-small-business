# Protocol-Ready Small Business Standard (PRSB)
### Version 0.1 — Draft for Community Review  
### Author: TechHammer (Scott Auffhammer)

A structured, open specification for transitioning small businesses into:

- **sovereign payments**
- **sovereign identity**
- **portable discovery**
- **transparent fulfillment**
- **value-for-value operations**
- **participatory co-creation**
- **reputation-native markets**

The goal is not to add “Bitcoin payments” to legacy businesses.

The goal is to **re-architect the small business as an economic node** inside the open protocol ecosystem (Bitcoin + Lightning + Nostr + open-catalog data).

This spec produces:
- more resilient businesses
- lower customer acquisition costs (CAC)
- radically faster settlement
- stronger trust & dispute resolution
- real transparency and observable competence
- reduced dependency on Web2 platforms
- higher community integration and contribution

## Current Status
This is a **draft standard**. It is meant to:
- be tested
- be improved
- be audited
- be extended
- be implemented in real operations

All contributions are signed, timestamped, and rewarded using sats.
