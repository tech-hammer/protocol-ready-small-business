# PRSB Neutrality & Non-Alignment Statement

## Purpose

The **Protocol Ready Small Business (PRSB)** specification defines constraints, interfaces, and reference patterns for small businesses operating on sovereign, open protocols rather than platform-dependent or fiat-native systems.

PRSB exists to make protocol readiness legible and verifiable.  
It does not exist to promote adoption, grow an audience, or advance any commercial interest.

---

## 1. Organizational Neutrality

PRSB is not affiliated with, governed by, or representative of any company, consultancy, accelerator, investment firm, nonprofit, or informal collective.

Any organization may implement PRSB-conforming systems or workflows.  
No organization is considered official, preferred, canonical, or endorsed.

PRSB does not link to, advertise, or direct attention toward commercial offerings or service providers.

---

## 2. Financial and Incentive Neutrality

PRSB does not prescribe business models, pricing structures, revenue strategies, or compensation mechanisms.

Use of fiat currency, Bitcoin, or other settlement methods occurs entirely outside the scope of the specification.

PRSB does not issue tokens, equity, credentials, certifications, or monetizable reputation assets.

---

## 3. Marketing and Growth Non-Participation

PRSB does not participate in:
- Marketing campaigns or growth initiatives  
- Brand promotion or thought leadership  
- Social media engagement strategies  
- Influencer, ambassador, or affiliate programs  
- Lead generation, onboarding funnels, or conversion metrics  

PRSB artifacts are published for inspection, implementation, and critique — not promotion.

Visibility, adoption, or recognition are not objectives of the specification.

---

## 4. Governance and Authority

PRSB has no foundation, steering committee, executive body, or formal leadership structure.

Specification changes are evaluated on technical clarity, constraint coherence, and internal consistency — not on identity, seniority, popularity, or affiliation.

Maintainers exist solely to curate, version, and clarify the specification.  
Maintainers do not represent users, implementers, or an ecosystem.

---

## 5. Reputation and Identity Boundaries

PRSB does not define user identities, profiles, rankings, or social graphs.

Any reputation or trust signaling derived from PRSB-conforming systems is external to the specification and must be grounded in verifiable work artifacts rather than attention or status.

PRSB defines no global reputation system.

---

## 6. Scope Limitations

PRSB explicitly does **not** define or provide:
- Job boards or hiring platforms  
- Marketplaces or exchanges  
- Communities, networks, or membership groups  
- Educational programs or certification tracks  
- Advocacy, political positions, or narratives  

Any such use is external to PRSB and is neither specified nor endorsed.

---

## 7. Relationship to Implementations

PRSB defines conformance criteria, not reference businesses or official deployments.

Independent implementations may diverge, fail, or be discontinued without affecting the validity of the specification.

No implementation is authoritative by virtue of proximity to the specification.

---

## 8. Authorship and Stewardship

PRSB is authored and maintained in a public repository.

Contributors may be credited for specific changes, but authorship does not confer ownership, control, or representational authority.

The specification may be forked, modified, or abandoned without permission.

---

## Final Constraint

PRSB is intentionally designed to resist capture by marketing, branding, or authority accumulation.

Any attempt to use PRSB as a vehicle for promotion, persuasion, or commercial advantage is a misuse of the specification.
