# PRSB Maintainers

## Purpose

This document defines the role, scope, and limitations of maintainers for the
**Protocol Ready Small Business (PRSB)** specification.

Maintainers exist to preserve clarity, consistency, and version integrity of the
specification. Maintainers do not represent users, implementers, organizations,
or an ecosystem.

---

## Role of Maintainers

Maintainers are responsible for:
- Reviewing proposed changes for internal consistency and scope alignment
- Merging contributions that meet specification requirements
- Managing versioning and changelog updates
- Clarifying ambiguous language without expanding scope
- Closing or rejecting proposals that violate neutrality or non-alignment constraints

Maintainers are not responsible for:
- Promoting PRSB
- Driving adoption or usage
- Coordinating communities or contributors
- Representing PRSB publicly
- Providing implementation guidance beyond what is documented

---

## Authority Boundaries

Maintainer authority is strictly limited to repository hygiene and specification
coherence.

Maintainers:
- Do not possess decision-making authority over implementations
- Do not grant approval, endorsement, or certification
- Do not assign reputation, status, or roles
- Do not act as gatekeepers to participation outside the repository

Disagreement with a maintainer’s decision does not require resolution.
The specification may be forked without permission.

---

## Initial Maintainers

At the time of publication, the PRSB specification is maintained by its initial
author(s).

Initial maintainers have no special or permanent authority beyond that required
to steward early versions of the specification.

Maintainership is a functional role, not an ownership claim.

---

## Changes to Maintainers

Maintainers may be added or removed through:
- Voluntary handoff
- Inactivity
- Consensus among active maintainers
- Forking of the specification

No formal election or approval process is required.

If maintainership becomes disputed, the specification may be forked.
Forking is considered a valid and sufficient resolution mechanism.

---

## Relationship to Organizations

Maintainers may be affiliated with companies or organizations in a personal
capacity.

Such affiliations do not grant those organizations authority, endorsement, or
special status within PRSB.

No organization is considered an official or canonical maintainer.

---

## Neutrality Enforcement

Maintainers are expected to enforce the neutrality and non-alignment constraints
defined in `GOVERNANCE/NEUTRALITY.md`.

Proposals that introduce marketing language, growth incentives, organizational
preference, or authority claims MUST be rejected.

---

## Final Constraint

Maintainers serve the specification, not its popularity.

If maintainership becomes a vector for control, promotion, or reputation
accumulation, the specification has failed to remain neutral.
