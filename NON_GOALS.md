# PRSB Non-Goals

This document enumerates explicit non-goals of the
**Protocol Ready Small Business (PRSB)** specification.

PRSB defines constraints and interfaces.  
Anything not explicitly defined is out of scope by default.

---

## 1. Adoption, Growth, or Promotion

PRSB does not aim to:
- Maximize adoption
- Grow a user base
- Increase visibility or awareness
- Encourage participation
- Optimize onboarding or conversion

PRSB does not measure success by usage, reach, or popularity.

---

## 2. Marketing, Branding, or Narrative

PRSB does not:
- Define messaging, positioning, or storytelling
- Provide marketing frameworks or playbooks
- Support brand-building or thought leadership
- Endorse narratives, movements, or campaigns

Any promotional use of PRSB is external and not endorsed.

---

## 3. Community or Network Formation

PRSB does not create or manage:
- Communities
- Networks
- Membership groups
- Forums, chats, or social spaces
- Ambassadors or representatives

Coordination defined by PRSB is artifact-based and time-bounded, not social.

---

## 4. Hiring, Employment, or Credentialing

PRSB does not:
- Operate job boards or talent marketplaces
- Define roles, titles, or career paths
- Issue credentials, certificates, or endorsements
- Match employers with workers

Any hiring or compensation activity occurs outside the specification.

---

## 5. Marketplaces or Commerce

PRSB does not define or operate:
- Marketplaces or exchanges
- Payment platforms
- Escrow or dispute resolution services
- Pricing or monetization models

PRSB may describe constraints relevant to commerce, but does not intermediate it.

---

## 6. Reputation Systems or Social Capital

PRSB does not define:
- Global reputation scores
- Ranking systems
- Follower or influence metrics
- Persistent social graphs

Any reputation or trust signaling is external, local, and implementation-specific.

---

## 7. Governance, Representation, or Advocacy

PRSB does not:
- Represent businesses, builders, or users
- Advocate for political, regulatory, or social positions
- Define voting, consensus, or representative governance models

Forking is the primary and sufficient mechanism for disagreement resolution.

---

## 8. Productization or Platform Ownership

PRSB is not:
- A product
- A platform
- A service
- A company
- An ecosystem

Implementations may exist independently, but none are canonical.

---

## Final Boundary

If a proposal requires persuasion, growth incentives, authority claims, or narrative framing to justify its inclusion, it is out of scope for PRSB.

PRSB exists to constrain behavior, not to mobilize people.
