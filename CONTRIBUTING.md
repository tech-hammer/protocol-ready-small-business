# CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES

## GOAL
Improve the Protocol Ready Small Business (PRSB) specification through:
- usability testing of protocol-constrained workflows
- operational validation against real business constraints
- transparency template refinements
- schema updates and clarifications
- documented implementation examples

## CONTRIBUTION TYPES
- bug reports identifying specification ambiguity or workflow friction
- documentation clarity and precision improvements
- catalog schema refinements
- Lightning-related interaction constraints or failure cases
- dispute model validation and edge-case analysis
- documented implementation examples (non-promotional)
- SOPs describing protocol-constrained operational workflows
- localization or translation of specification documents

## REWARD MODEL
Approved contributions may, at the discretion of independent implementers or maintainers, be acknowledged through voluntary Bitcoin payments (e.g., zap, Lightning invoice, or value-for-value streams).

PRSB does not prescribe or guarantee compensation for contributions.

## PROCESS
1. Open an issue describing the proposed change or clarification
2. Submit a pull request or structured notes
3. Participate in the technical review thread
4. Once merged:
   - the contributor MAY sign the contribution with a cryptographic key
   - the merge is recorded in the public repository history
5. Any reputation or trust signaling derived from contributions is external to PRSB and not defined by this specification

Proposals that conflict with documented non-goals in `NON_GOALS.md` will be rejected.
